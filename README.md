# Virtual Home Lab

This project simlulates a multi-VLAN home netowork using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
It demonstrates inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, DNS, and NAT configurations to replicate real-world networking concepts within a virtual environment. 

## Features
- Multi-VLAN segmentation (Admin, Users, Servers)
- Inter-VLAN routing with DHCP for dynamic addressing
- DNS services for hostname resolution
- NAT for internet connectivity simulation
- Hands-on ACL testing and troubleshooting

## Outcome 
Gained practical experience in network design, protocol configuration, and troubleshooting.
