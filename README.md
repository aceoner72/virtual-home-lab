# Virtual Home Lab

This project simlulates a multi-VLAN home netowork using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
It demonstrates inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, DNS, and NAT configurations to replicate real-world networking concepts within a virtual environment and no physical hardware. 

## Overview 
- Designed and implemented a multi-VLAN topology (Admin, Users, Servers).
- Configured inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, DNS, and NAT segmented internal networks with centralized services.
- Tested connectivity and troubleshooting across VLANs to reinforce networking fundamentals.

## Purpose
The goal of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with Cisco networking concepts, practice core configurations, and develop troubleshooting skills in a virtual environment. 

## Outcome 
Successfully built a functional network simulation that mirrors enterprise-style setups, strengthening skills in network design, protocol configuration, and problem-solving.
